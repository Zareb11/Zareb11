Hi, I am Jacob Witbooi currently living in Cape Town, South Africa. I love working on software projects and I am interested in linguistics, culture, science and software.
I am currently learning microservices, Docker, Kubernetes and Full Stack development. 

My programming languages at the moment are Python, Java and C++. I am doing small projects as time goes by but learning on YouTube and Udemy.
My email is jacobrwitbooi@gmail.com for anyone that wants to reach me for collaboration or anything software related.
